## Design Plan

  - Diagrams
  - Prioritised list of functionality
    - User can create words by dragging and dropping mouse
  - Extension options
    - Annoying colour changes in the last 10 seconds to distract
    - Taunting messages if the user hasn't found a word in a while
    - Letters randomly go invisible
    - Background going crazy colours towards the end
- Design
  - Sketch layout in Excalidraw
  - HTML design in paint
  - Draft algorithm
