Implementation of the classic Boggle game in Svelte.

Deployed (here)[https://boggle-taupe.vercel.app/]

## Design Plan

- Create specification
  - Diagrams
  - Prioritised list of functionality
    - User can create words by dragging and dropping mouse
    - Words are only accepted if they are an english word
    - If the user puts in an invalid word, they are given a relevant error message
    - User is given a time limit
    - User is given the list of possible words at the end of the game
  - Extension options
    - Annoying colour changes in the last 10 seconds to distract
    - Taunting messages if the user hasn't found a word in a while
    - Letters randomly go invisible
    - Background going crazy colours towards the end
- Design
  - Sketch layout in Excalidraw
  - HTML design in paint
  - Draft algorithm
